# 🚀 Quantum Task Manager

Quantum Task Manager is a beautiful and lightweight web-based task manager built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It helps users keep track of tasks, assign priorities, set due dates, and visualize progress — all within a clean, responsive interface that runs entirely in the browser.

## 📖 About This Project

**Quantum Task Manager** is designed for people who want a minimalist yet powerful way to organize daily tasks without needing to log in or set up a database. The app uses `localStorage` to store task data, so your tasks remain saved even after refreshing or closing the tab.

Key functionalities include:
- Creating, editing, and deleting tasks
- Assigning task priorities (Low, Medium, High)
- Setting deadlines for each task
- Switching between Light and Dark themes
- Viewing a live progress bar and productivity statistics

It's perfect for beginners looking to master **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **localStorage** in JavaScript while also learning how to build a responsive UI with CSS.
